# How to Run
1. CD to chosen directory - Git clone https://github.com/alegueri/SimpleInventoryTracker.git OR download folder as ZIP. 
2. In the client directory, run the command "npm run dev". This command executes both the front-end and the back-end concurrently. 
3. Ensure wifi network is stable, and that the database is connected. The console should indicate a "connected" message. 
4. The front-end will run through 'http://localhost:3000/' in the browser automatically where the interface can be seen.

If you wish to run back-end and front-end seperately. 
1. CD into 'server' and run "npm run start" 
2. open a new terminal simultaneously, and CD into 'client'. Run "npm start". 

This will execute the same as above.
